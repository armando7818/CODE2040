# CODE2040

<B>Feedback on challenge</B><br>
Overall, I believe that the hardest part about this assignment was being able to learn how to use JSON with java
to be able to send and recieve data from the server. If you could not figure this part out, then you could not finish or
even start on the assignment. This assignment really taught me how to think outside the box because I had to self teach myself
a lot of material in the last two days because I only recently found out about this application from a friend 
who had a internship through this pathway. The coding in general was not so difficult, it was mainly the exposure
you needed to begin this assignment. I found myself looking through a lot of java classes to figure this out and had to draw 
upon preivous coding assignments where I had to use JSON.
